          Why do I work with computers?&nbsp; It began with taking apart
          two-stroke motorcycles; then came the iconic MG sports car…. a project
          consisting of boxes of parts requiring assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p data-v-4b553c36="">
          My aptitude for systems had its foundation formed; at the age of
          fourteen I was able to extract the MG’s motor and transmission in one
          hour.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was the only 8th grader with a sports car.&nbsp;

          Finding math to be intuitive, becoming a physics major in college,
          selling an electronic shopping system to a supermarket my junior
          year:&nbsp; I realized my future was with computers.&nbsp; Providing
          me the perfect puzzle…. finding solutions to unending challenges.

          According to Pymetrics the most important thing for a coder to succeed
          is aptitude. Attitude is a close second and training a faraway third.
          With today's development environment; aptitude and google will get you
          a long way towards completing a project.

          I used to like telling my mom she picked a good dad and I would tell
          my dad he picked a good mom.&nbsp; My mom encouraged my curiosity and
          the pleasure of reading to develop my imagination.&nbsp; My dad made
          math fun, he was a pioneer programmer and introduced me to the world
          of coding.

          I build and maintain complex systems within multiple environments. I
          am lucky to be in this profession. &nbsp;I believe it is truly what I
          should be doing!
