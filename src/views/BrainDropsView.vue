                  On my first job, I killed a $4 million Navy project and had a
                  very angry admiral admonish me! I was very confident of my
                  MSDOS skills and I was asked to copy a file to a UNIX
                  workstation. The copy command in UNIX copied the file where I
                  told it to copy, unfortunately the path description was not
                  detailed enough and started copying onto the drive over the
                  workstation's OS files. Without an OS we were not able to
                  continue with the project!</span

                  >On the next project they put me on, the first thing I did
                  without being asked, was to write a backup program for our
                  project files. The backup program became a very integral part
                  of the project and evolved into our version control
                  system.</span

                  the hard drive and recovered the files using the drive as an
                  external drive instead of the OS drive. For some reason no one
                  ask me what I thought. I still do not know why they ran a $4
                  million navy project without backup for the source
                  files.</span

                  best parking space when I swerved to miss the mother of all
                  potholes. For the first week I forgot to avoid the pothole
                  every morning as I hunted down my parking space. Most of the
                  time I missed it, and like the other parking space hunters of
                  the building I just became conditioned to miss it.</span

                  lost souls looking for safe refuge. That pothole was still a
                  menace. I thought that asphalt was still a
                  government-controlled substance, but I was able to obtain some
                  from Home Depot and I was able to patch it in about a half an
                  hour.</span

                  mentioned that is was fixed, he stopped, asked the person on
                  the phone if he could call them back and then gave me his
                  complete attention. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;, he asked. I repeated
                  it was fixed and he turned around and looked out his window to
                  see the hole was gone. He thanked me and that was it.</span
